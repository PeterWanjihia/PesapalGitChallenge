# Version Control System Staging Area Development

## Accomplishments So Far

### 1. File Hashing and Metadata Management
- **Hashing Functionality**: Implemented SHA-256 hashing for files in the repository
- **Metadata Writing**: File metadata stored in `.repo/objects/index` directory
- **Staging Area Implementation**: File paths and hashes stored in `.repo/staging/staged_files.txt`

### 2. Basic Staging Area Logic
- Successfully adds individual files to repository and staging area
- Correctly computes and stores file hashes

## Remaining Development Tasks

### 1. Multi-File Handling
- Enhance system to add multiple files simultaneously (e.g., `./program add file1.txt file2.txt`)

### 2. File Removal from Staging
- Implement ability to remove files from staging area
- Example command: `./program remove file1.txt`

### 3. Tracking Changed Files
- Implement logic to:
  - Check if file exists in staging area
  - Compare current file hash with stored hash
  - Only add to staging if hashes differ

### 4. File Hash Management
- Ensure hash integrity
- Update or remove hashes when files are modified or removed
- Consider potential hash collision scenarios

### 5. Enhance Staging Area Functions
- Modularize staging logic into specific functions:
  - `add_to_staging_area()`
  - `remove_from_staging_area()`
  - `has_file_changed()`

### 6. Staging Output Management
- Improve user feedback
- Provide clear messages about staging area actions

### 7. Future Scalability
- Prepare for handling:
  - Large file sizes
  - Large numbers of files in staging area

## Suggested Next Steps

1. **Implement File Removal**
   - Develop `remove_from_staging_area()` function
   - Ensure repository index remains unaffected

2. **Track Changed Files**
   - Compare current file hash with staged file hash
   - Add only changed files to staging

3. **Enhance Staging Area Management**
   - Modularize core functions
   - Improve system extensibility

4. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Multiple file additions
   - File modifications after staging
   - Removing unstaged files
   - Complex staging scenarios

5. **Improve User Feedback**
   - Create informative output messages
   - Provide clear status updates
