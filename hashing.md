# Technical Development Rationale

## Initial Implementation Strategy: Pragmatic Foundations

When initiating the project, I adopted a direct, pragmatic approach by consolidating initial functionality into a single file (`file.c`). This strategy was deliberate and served critical initial objectives:

**Design Constraints and Strategic Considerations:**
- Rapid prototype development
- Immediate testability of core initialization logic
- Minimizing overhead during proof-of-concept phase

**Recognized Limitations:**
- Scalability constraints becoming evident
- Increasing complexity risking code manageability
- Limited potential for modular expansion

## Architectural Refactoring: Transitioning to Modular Design

Recognizing the inherent limitations of the monolithic approach, I strategically refactored the project architecture with a focus on:

### Structural Principles
- Explicit separation of concerns
- Enhanced code reusability
- Clean, predictable integration patterns

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Decomposed `file.c` into specialized modules
- Created dedicated `init.c` for repository initialization
- Developed targeted header files for inter-module communication

## File Hashing Implementation: Technical Deep Dive

### Cryptographic Hashing Strategy
**Algorithm Selection: SHA-256**
- Cryptographically robust
- Collision-resistant
- Industry-standard approach to content identification

### Memory-Efficient Processing Methodology
- Implemented chunk-based file reading
- Fixed-size buffer processing
- Constant memory footprint regardless of file size

### Metadata Management
Designed a lightweight, extensible metadata tracking mechanism in `.repo/objects/index`:
- Minimal storage overhead
- Easy parsing
- Future-proof schema design

## Validation and Testing Approach

**Comprehensive Testing Framework:**
- Edge case validation
- Performance scenario simulation
- Robust error handling verification

**Test Scenarios Covered:**
- Empty file processing
- Large file handling
- Non-existent file error management

## Architectural Benefits of Modular Design

**Key Advantages:**
- Linear scalability
- Isolated module testing
- Simplified debugging
- Enhanced code maintainability

## Strategic Project Progression

**Completed Milestones:**
- Repository initialization infrastructure
- File tracking and hashing mechanism

**Upcoming Development Phases:**
- Staging area implementation
- Commit system design
