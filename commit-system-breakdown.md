# Commit System: Comprehensive Breakdown

## Inputs to the Commit System

### Staged Files (Staging Area)
The files that have been added to the staging area are the core input. These include:
- New files added to the repository
- Modified files changed since the last commit
- Deleted files removed from the staging area

**Input**: A list of staged files (file paths or file hashes)

### Commit Message
An essential input that describes the changes and provides context.

**Input**: A string representing the commit message (e.g., "Fix issue with user authentication")

### Parent Commit(s)
Creates a chain of commits and links commit history.

**Input**: Commit ID(s) of parent commit(s)

### Author Information
Details about the person making the commit.

**Input**: Author name and email (e.g., "John Doe john.doe@example.com")

### Timestamp
The exact time when the commit is made.

**Input**: System-generated timestamp

## Outputs of the Commit System

### Commit ID (Hash)
A unique identifier generated by hashing the commit's contents.

**Output**: Unique commit ID (e.g., abc123def456...)

### Commit Object
Contains:
- File hashes for staged files
- Commit message
- Author name and email
- Timestamp
- Parent commit(s)
- Commit ID

**Output**: Commit object stored in content-addressable storage

### Commit History
Updated by adding the new commit to the chain.

**Output**: Commit history updated with new commit

### Branch Reference Update
The branch pointer is updated to point to the new commit.

**Output**: Branch reference points to new commit ID

### Commit Metadata (Optional)
Additional metadata might be stored separately.

## Commit System Flow

### Before Committing
1. Files are staged
2. Commit message prepared
3. Parent commit, author info, and timestamp ready

### Commit Creation
1. Hash staged files
2. Create commit object
3. Generate commit ID by hashing commit object

### Commit Storage
1. Store commit object using commit ID
2. Update commit history
3. Update branch reference

### Post-Commit
- Commit history grows
- Branch pointer points to latest commit

## Real-World Example (in Git)

### Inputs
- Staged Files: file1.txt, file2.txt
- Commit Message: "Fixed bug in user authentication"
- Parent Commit: abc123
- Author Info: "John Doe <john.doe@example.com>"
- Timestamp: "2024-12-10 10:15:00"

### Outputs
- Commit ID: def456789...
- Commit Object: Contains file hashes, message, author info
- Updated Commit History: Linked to parent commit
- Branch Reference: main now points to new commit ID

## Summary of Inputs and Outputs

| Inputs | Outputs |
|--------|---------|
| Staged Files | Commit ID |
| Commit Message | Commit Object |
| Parent Commit(s) | Updated Commit History |
