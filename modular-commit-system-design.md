# Modular Commit System Design

## Overview

To design a robust, modular commit system, we will break it down into smaller, manageable functions that each handle a single responsibility. This approach will make the system modular, clean, and easier to maintain or extend in the future.

We'll focus on separating concerns and organizing the commit functionality into well-defined files and functions. The functionalities can be categorized into:
- Core commit operations
- Metadata management
- Commit object creation
- Commit history management
- Commit ID generation
- Branch update

## Function Categories and Responsibilities

### 1. Commit Creation & Metadata Handling

These are the core functions responsible for creating the commit and handling metadata.

#### `create_commit_object()`
- **File:** `commit_create.c`
- **Responsible for creating the commit object with metadata:**
  - Staged file hashes
  - Commit message
  - Parent commit reference(s)
  - Timestamp
  - Author information (name, email)

#### `generate_commit_id()`
- **File:** `commit_utils.c`
- **Purpose:** Generates a unique commit ID by hashing the commit content
  - Includes staged files, commit message, author, timestamp, and parent commit
- Ensures deterministic commits

#### `store_commit_object()`
- **File:** `commit_storage.c`
- **Purpose:** Stores the commit object in content-addressable storage
  - Typically in a `.repo/objects/` directory
  - Uses commit ID as the filename

### 2. Commit History Management

These functions manage the commit history and link commits in a chain.

#### `update_commit_history()`
- **File:** `commit_history.c`
- **Purpose:** Updates the commit history
  - Adds new commit object to the commit log
  - Ensures it points to its parent commit

#### `get_commit_history()`
- **File:** `commit_history.c`
- **Purpose:** Retrieves the commit history
  - Fetches previous commits (parent commits)
  - Useful when creating a new commit

### 3. Branch Management

These functions manage branch references and ensure the correct commit is pointed to by the active branch.

#### `update_branch_reference()`
- **File:** `commit_branch.c`
- **Purpose:** Updates branch reference (e.g., `refs/heads/main`)
  - Points to the new commit
  - Tracks the current head of the branch

#### `get_branch_reference()`
- **File:** `commit_branch.c`
- **Purpose:** Retrieves the current commit pointed to by the branch reference

### 4. Commit Validation & Error Handling

These functions validate the commit operation and handle potential errors.

#### `validate_staged_files()`
- **File:** `commit_validate.c`
- **Purpose:** Validates staged files
  - Checks if files exist in the staging area
  - Ensures the staging area is not empty

#### `check_for_changes()`
- **File:** `commit_validate.c`
- **Purpose:** Checks for actual changes
  - Compares staged files with the last commit
  - Ensures only meaningful changes are committed

#### `validate_commit_message()`
- **File:** `commit_validate.c`
- **Purpose:** Validates commit message
  - Ensures message is non-empty
  - Checks conformity to format and length requirements

### 5. Commit Metadata Management

Functions dealing with authoring and timestamping commits.

#### `get_commit_author()`
- **File:** `commit_metadata.c`
- **Purpose:** Fetches author's information
  - Retrieves name and email
  - Sources: environment variables or configuration file

#### `get_commit_timestamp()`
- **File:** `commit_metadata.c`
- **Purpose:** Fetches the current timestamp of the commit

### 6. Auxiliary Utility Functions

Additional functions for logging, error handling, and commit status.

#### `log_commit_activity()`
- **File:** `commit_utils.c`
- **Purpose:** Logs commit activity for debugging and auditing

#### `handle_commit_error()`
- **File:** `commit_utils.c`
- **Purpose:** Handles and displays errors during the commit process

### 7. Commit Workflow (Integration)

#### `commit_changes()`
- **File:** `commit_workflow.c`
- **Purpose:** Handles the entire commit workflow
  - Validates staged files
  - Generates commit ID
  - Creates commit object
  - Stores commit
  - Updates commit history
  - Updates branch reference
  - Logs activity
